    "description":"	The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSLv2 and/or SSLv3, which reportedly suffers from several cryptographic flaws and has been deprecated for several years. An attacker may be able to exploit these issues to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks or decrypt communications between the affected service and clients.",
